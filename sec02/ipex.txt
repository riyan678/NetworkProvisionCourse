Preboot Execution Environment (iPXE)
**allows for network based booting
**can be configure from rommon shell/network os
**uses dhcp to get an ip address first
  **can then download load image file via tftp/ftp/http

How iPXE Works
1. client send dhcp request to dhcp server
  ** ONE OR Both of these options can be set
  ** option 60 should be set to (vendor): ciscopnp
  ** option 61 should be set to (device sn): 9G7LDZKE6F4

2. The dhcp server will send an offer
  ** next-server (siaddr): 203.0.113.1 # this filled contains the ip address of the tftp server
  ** bootfile (file): nos.bin # this filled contains the name of the file
     Note: the bootfile filled can also supply a full url in the boot file string to include 
           method and filename if you are using http or ftp ex: (bootfile: http://203.0.113.1/nos.bin)

3. client get info from dchp server and then send read request to tftp server for nos.bin

4. tftp file is downloaded to the client from server

5. When download is complete the client will begin to boot from the downloaded image
