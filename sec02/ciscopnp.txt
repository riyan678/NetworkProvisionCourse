Cisco Plug in Play (PnP)
**highly scalable and secure provision solution
**a feature of dna center
** can identify the intial configurations and network os images
** clients use dhcp server to find dna center instances
** does not require option 60 and 61
** device to config mapping occurs centrally on dna center
** uses workflows then claim a device as apart of that work flow

Core PnP Components
1. ip connectivity between client and dna center

2. client has pnp agent running at boot time

3. pnp agent will connect to pnp server (dna center)
  The pnp protocol is used for this connection
  xml over http rpc messages

How Cisco PnP Works 
1. Client send dhcp discover

2. dhcp server sends offer with option dnac ip
   ** opt 43 198.51.100.42
   ** If opt 43 is omitted and domain name is specified
      will try to find the sever via dns instead
   **(domain name: lctcs.edu)
   **(agent will query pnpserver.lctcs.edu)

3. client gets ip address and sen http post/pnp/work request to dnac

4. dnac will respond with and http response + network os, config file, or both

5. device are added to dnac inventory automatically during this process
