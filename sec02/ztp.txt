Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP)
**used to boot devices with os installed already
**network based intial configuration
**can use to perform the intial configuration
**depending on design can include full connectivity to the network
**in other cases it maybe just an out of band connection
**Similar to Ipxe in that it uses dhcp to get ip address and file transfer to download a file,
  execept uses a python script
**in the event of a python script, the client download script and run it locally
**modern ios devices has an guestshell IOx container

How ztp Works
1. client send dhcp request
   option 60 and 61 are set

2. dhcp offer is sent from dhcp server with tftp
  opt 150: 203.0.113.1
  opt 67: ztp.py

3. client gets ip address and send read request to tftp server

4. client download the file and rename it to downloaded_script.py

5. the client then enable guestshell and runs the script
